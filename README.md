# üöÄ TypeScript Basics

Welcome to my **TypeScript Basics** repository! üéâ This repo contains a series of exercises and code samples that I completed while taking the [TypeScript Course](https://platzi.com/cursos/typescript/) on Platzi. Each file is designed to help solidify the fundamentals of TypeScript, from working with simple types to more advanced concepts like union types and functions.

## üìö Course Information

I followed the **[TypeScript Course on Platzi](https://platzi.com/cursos/typescript/)**, which covers everything from basic data types to functions and objects in TypeScript. The goal is to learn TypeScript's static typing and build more robust applications.

3. `03-demo.ts` - Working with basic TypeScript syntax.
4. `03-typing.ts` - Learning about type annotations.
5. `04-numbers.ts` - Handling numbers in TypeScript.
6. `05-booleans.ts` - Boolean values and logic.
7. `06-strings.ts` - Manipulating strings in TypeScript.
8. `07-arrays.ts` - Working with arrays and different type combinations.

## üö© Key Learnings

Throughout these exercises, I've learned how to:

- Use TypeScript's type annotations for numbers, booleans, strings, and arrays.
- Work with more complex types such as `any` and union types.
- Implement functions with return types and object parameters.
- Handle `undefined` and `null` values in a safe way.
- Work with dates using external libraries like `date-fns`.
